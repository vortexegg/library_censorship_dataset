"A book on terrorism was challenged by a student because the cover showed a pic of Middle Eastern people. He hadn't read it but I gave him the book challenge form, but it never came back. Just as I suspected, he was more interested in creating a stir that actually doing something about it.",Northeast,Urban,0,0,1
A community read book (selected by another librarian in district) was challenged by a parent in my building. I had to provide evidence that book was age-appropriate (commonsense media) and reviewed well. Book was Hoot by Hiaasen and it was challenged due to language - ass damn,Northeast,Small Town,1,1,0
"A kindergarten student took out a book on terrorism but thought it was about fire fighters because of the fire on the front. The parent called and asked why her child would've been allowed to take this book. I explained that it had slipped by in error and yes, it should not have been checked out to her young child. I do not censor titles but I do believe in age appropriateness and do not allow children to take out books that are not age appropriate.",Canada,Small Town,1,1,0
"A parent asked that we remove all goosebumps and similar books from the library. I explained the process for challenging a book. I also explained that they had the right to limit what their child could read, but not what other children could read. They did not go forward with the challenge.",Canada,Urban,1,1,0
"A parent brought a challenge directly to our principal over the title ""L8R, G8R"" by Lauren Myracle. We had TTYL & TTFN also on the shelves and the books were consistently and extremely popular with 6th grade girls. I bought the 3rd book based on the series popularity without having read the book, and by the reviews. I then read the book and agree that it was not appropriate for middle school. However, I believed and still do that the other two books are fine for our school library. The principal supported the parent in requesting all 3 books be removed. My English teachers privately agreed with me, but didn't object the principal's decision.",Pacific,Small Town,0,1,0
"A parent brought concerns about a book to the principal. A meeting was held with myself, principal, district representatives and the parent. We thought she would go through the formal challenge procedure. Instead she went to the Media (print & TV) to try to get the book banned. She felt this was her parental mission - to protect ALL students from this book. She never filed the paperwork and left the district. Administration asked that I remove the book from elementary to prevent any further problems. I acquiesced.",Mountain,Urban,1,1,0
"A parent came in and wanted the book Wicked : the life and times of the wicked witch of the West : a novel, by Gregory Maguire taken off the shelf because of its content. I received information from my principal about a committee that was being formed to make the review. I read the book and made detailed notes on everything I thought she could object to. She came in to find out the particulars and I told her that in order for the challenge to go forward, one of the stipulations by the district review process was that she had to read the entire book so she could see the ""problems"" in the context of the whole book. She was unwilling to do that, so the challenge was dropped and the book stayed on the shelf. I have a sign in my library that very plainly states that there are all kinds of books on the shelves and it is up to the readers and their parents to decide what is best for them. I also sometimes use a little shoe store analogy with students who question my choice of books. When you go to a shoe store, do you throw away every pair of shoes you take off the shelf and don't like? No, you put them back and pretty soon someone will come along who likes those shoes.",Mountain,Suburban,0,0,1
"A parent challenged the book ""Out of the Dust"", stating that it was too violent for her fourth grade student. The challenge was settled by the site level review committee. Reference was made to a former BOE decision on a challenged book that was a result of mediation. The parent did not appeal to the next level (district level review committee). Her student finished the year at our school and, subsequently, was transferred to private school.",South Central,Suburban,1,0,0
"A parent challenged ""The Golden Compass,"" claiming I would turn all the children into atheist. I assured her that was not going to happen and explained it was her right as a parent to tell her child what they could read but not the books in my library. She didn't read the book and never pursued the challenge. I did speak with my admin so they knew what was going on.",Northeast,Suburban,0,1,0
"A parent objected to her daughter borrowing So Hard to Say by Alex Sanchez based on reading the jacket copy. I explained my policy of including books that reflect our school community; she denied the existence of homosexuals in the school community. We have gay staff members, children of gay parents, and children who are gay or questioning, as is the main character in So Hard to Say. The school board president read the book, CCBC provided reviews and support materials. It was the first time anyone else read the library selection policy. The book is still in our collection.",Midwest,Urban,1,1,0
A parent objected to the book Aimee. She did not read the book. Her objection was really about the cover on the book. The model did not appear to have clothes on (wrapped in a sheet) and it implied a sexual story line.,Midwest,Rural,0,1,1
"A parent talked to me about the book Swim the Fly has a blurb on the cover about boys wanting to see a naked girl. It was a Abe Lincoln award nominee at the time so it was on display. I asked her if she had ever read the book and she said she had not. I told her that I had and although the boys do have that as a goal it doesn't work out the way that they thought it would (they see naked older people) and by the end of the book the protagonist matures and learns to value girls for more than just their looks. The cover is designed to get boys to read the book, but the book itself has a positive message and I invited her to read it. I also asked her if she wanted to make a formal challenge. We talked some more and she decided to drop the matter.",Midwest,Suburban,0,0,1
A parent told me that I should remove a book because it contained nude images of fairies... She did not seem open to discussion on the subject so I removed the book for the duration of her visit and then replaced it on the shelf. End of story.,Pacific,Suburban,1,1,0
A parent told me that she and her boys were listening to an audiobook in the cart and she didn't feel it was appropriate for their age level. I had read the book so I informed her that the book was not for her boys but was appropriate for an older audience. I told her to read reviews before she borrowed audiobooks or any book to know the target audience.,Northeast,Suburban,1,1,0
A situation where a middle school parent objected to her foster child borrowing a book relating to teenagers and sex. She wanted the book to not be a part of the collection. I suggested that the choice of this book might be a good opportunity for conversation that the student could find useful - if not with the foster parent than with someone else.,Northeast,Small Town,0,1,0
"A student checked out Speak by L.H. Anderson for a book report and her mother made her bring it back and get something else, and suggested the book be removed from the library. I did not remove it from the library. There was another book years ago that a parent challenged for bad language. Because it wasn't that great of a book anyway, and was old and not being checked out very often at all, I just removed it and didn't think twice about it.",Midwest,Small Town,1,1,0
"A teacher aid complained about the vampire books in the collection, 58 out of over 17,000. This number included vampire bats, the ""Twilight"" series, and ""Bunnicular"". There processes ended in the library's favor after a full title review by administration and teachers from a different school. After 8 years I have had 3 challenges, Two in favor of the library, and one I agreed with the parent, the book was written for a more mature age group than the middle school.",Midwest,Rural,0,1,0
"A teacher questioned the appropriateness of The Da Vinci Code in the collection, saying it countered her religious beliefs and was blasphemous. Asked if we had religiously controversial titles such as Satanic Verses (we do). Used the materials selection policy to validate selections. No formal challenge was made, though I offered the option of placing one.",Canada,Urban,0,0,1
"A teacher thought Shrek by William Steig was inappropriate because the ogres are described as ugly. I regretfully did not add a book about a transgender child because ""our community is not ready for that,"" and I serve at the whim of a board of trustees made up predominantly of parents.",South Atlantic,Suburban,1,1,0
"A volunteer did not notice the restricted label on a book and checked out a book to a 2nd grader that had mature content and language. The student's mother was very upset and asked for the book to be removed (""It has no place in a Catholic School!"") and wanted to know how books were selected. I explained that her daughter should never have had the book, and that it was marked for 6-8th grades. I also explained that books were chosen based on professional reviews, curriculum considerations.This mother has not pursued the issue, but has asked that her daughter's books be screened. I plan to present a Collection Development Policy along with a Materials Challenge form to my administrator soon.",Midwest,Suburban,1,1,0

"Again, I don't buy a book just because it contains something, nor do I exclude it just because it does. So yes, some books that others might take issue with - for whatever reason - sometimes don't get the nod. I have finite resources. I take reviews into account for most purchases, but certainly not all. I purchase all books on our HS state reading lists, regardless of content.",South Central,Urban,0,0,1
Age appropriateness is a tough thing in middle school where some students are more mature than others but yet might not be ready to read high school material. It's tough to balance appropriateness with not censoring.,Northeast,Suburban,0,1,0
"All too often lately I have shied away from purchasing a book because SLJ reviews it for grade 10 and up, while several other review sources say it's appropriate for younger ages -- sometimes much younger. Occasionally when I read the book for myself I agree, but usually I have a hard time seeing what makes something ""grade 10 and up"" as opposed to ""grade 9 and up.""",Mountain,Urban,0,1,1
"Almost Perfect by Brian Katcher A parent bypassed the in place reconsideration form and sent 20 annotated pages of the book ( with underlined offensive content AND the reasons she believed it was inappropriate) to every member of the school board and superintendent without discussing the matter with me first. The board immediately required a committee set up (the next day--without giving time for the committee to read the book). The committee, consisting of the principal, a teacher, two parents and myself, decided to keep the book. When the parent was unhappy with the outcome, a district committee was formed. They decided to move the book to the high school. As a result, my superintendent wanted a list of ""all of the books that could be considered controversial"". I told him that my list would include every book in the collection, because someone might find any book offensive. I also said the book at the top of the list would be the Bible. We compromised, he insisted on permission slips to check out ""mature content"" books.",Midwest,Suburban,0,1,0
"Although they're not required in our selection process, I do read and rely on professional review, particularly School Library Journal, Hornbook, and BookList, although I read others as well. I particularly pay attention to the grade level recommendations. I have the most trouble deciding on books recommended for grades 5-8, knowing that 2nd graders are going to pick them up to read too. I do wish that reviewers would warn about profanity, as that's something even my students come and tell me they're uncomfortable with. Often I haven't been aware of it until that happens.",South Atlantic,Suburban,1,0,0

"Because we are private religious school, I sometimes have to refrain from buying books that might be too controversial for the student and parent body. I often try to replace it with something less controversial but on the same topic.",Northeast,Suburban,0,0,1
"Believe it or not, the book that was challenged wasn't for content but rather for age. The back of the book stated for ages 10+ and a parent questioned why it was required reading for a tenth (ages 15-16) grade ELA class I was teaching. The book was Harris and Me by Gary Paulsen. The protagonists remind me of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, and the novel is simply a lot of fun and drama in a coming of age story. There's a bit of language and semi-adult situations, but totally innocuous considering today's teens.",South Atlantic,Urban,0,0,1
Book challenge was handled in house. I think the main publishing houses are too controlling of the content of the books we buy.,Mountain,Rural,0,1,1
Book challenged years ago on: High school-- Snow Falling on Cedars and Tree of Red Stars due to sexual content; the cover of a book with a gun on it. Elementary school--challenge on a poetry book that had a person throwing a boy out a high rise; Bone series because the character went into a bar and requested a beer; swear words in a book a 2nd grader checked out;,Pacific,Rural,1,0,1
"Both book challenges initiated by parents were dropped when I called the parent, listened to her complaints, clarified that she certainly had the right to keep her student from reading any book she thought was unsuitable, explained further that her challenge would mean the book would be removed from the shelf, making it unavailable for other students, talked further about reasons why I and other library media professionals thought the book appropriate for this collection. After our conversations, I sent out the required School District paperwork, which requires challenging parties to read the book. They chose not to pursue the challenge further.",South Atlantic,Urban,0,0,1
"Both of my experiences were actually requests for consideration that didn't up escalating to a formal challenge. One was The Queen of Cool by Cecil Castellucci, and the other was This One Summer by Mariko and Jillian Tamaki. Both requests were from 6th grade parents (youngest grade level on my campus), and both went to the principal 1st. I read both books, thought they were probably a little mature for 6th grade, but definitely saw the value in having them in the collection for older students. I explained to parents why they were important to have in the collection, but understood their concerns (language, drug/alcohol use, sexual situation). I put a YA sticker on them, and now if 6th grade students want to check out those books they have to have parent permission. Both were satisfied with that solution and did not wish to take the issue further.",South Central,Suburban,0,1,0

"Earlier in my career a parent challenged a paperback book that had a picture of a girl riding a horse on the cover. As the 3rd grade girl liked horses she borrowed the book. There was a scene in the book describing the girls breasts bouncing while she was riding the book. The parent was reading the book with the student and was distrubed by this passage. As I had not purchased the book for the library, and I believe it was a donation before I began my position, I decided to delete the book from the collection. It wasn't great literature anyway.",Northeast,Suburban,1,0,0
Grandparent challenged the book Little Rabbit Foo Foo stating main character was a bully. Book was reviewed by a panel of educators at the district level and was returned to the shelf.,Mountain,Urban,1,1,0
"Graphic novel...This One Summer...many students were returning it complaining of content. Attempted to discuss ...did they notice the difference in the way the character responded to the female and males in text etc...no go ...couldn't get past the strong language...mention of topics like blow jobs...etc Finally one student and her parent had brought the text in with sticky notes on all the pages with strong language, mention of porn, and the male sexual conversations. There were more than 25 sticky notes. She was offered the proper paperwork etc. During review I was able to convince them how this text really speaks to some students even though I myself was surprised by the highly controversial material for our ages. It is a book that begs analysis with peers but so many of our students found it offensive and I respect the desire to draw the line...The reviews DID NOT GO far enough in sharing about the controversial content for middle school students to inform my purchase. I bought 2 copies and am disappointed with the purchase. Sorry wrote this quickly",South Central,Small Town,0,1,0
"Having an administrator refuse to let me purchase several books because he didn't approve of their content is not an official challenge as defined by our selection policy.

"I address the issue of reading level vs. content with my students.......... both those who are restricted from our junior high section and those who are allowed to use it. We discuss 'bad language' in books (why does the character use it -- is this normal? -- why is it 'bad' and would you use it) ; 'mature' content in books ( why is it included -- how do you view it) ; historical fiction vs. historical fact vs. historical viewpoint; science books, etc = do you laugh because it is funny or uncomfortable ? do you only laugh in a group or actually sit by yourself and laugh at scientific info?

"I am the coordinator of librarians in my county so I have info from other schools as well: 1. The book ""Flowers in the Attic"" (which was purchased by the previous librarian and in the collection for many years) was challenged when I worked at a middle school. It, however, was not an official challenge because our administration does not follow the School Board approved challenge policy and just pulls books off the shelves if a parent objects. :( It was removed and I sent it to the high school. 2. This year a parent complained about sexual content in a book called ""Mostly Good Girls"". The school serves grades 6-12. A middle school aged student had checked it out. The principal called me at home, since I am the ""head"" librarian, to fuss about the book (I do not work in that building); he took the book and it disappeared. That school has a policy that if a book is recommended as YA a spine label is attached so ""only"" high schoolers can check it out and it not allowed for middle school students. This book was YA in the reviews but the label was not affixed to it. Once again the challenge policy was not followed. 3. A parent at an elementary school complained that the giant in ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" gets drunk. All copies of the book were pulled from the library shelves in our entire county. SIGH Once again the challenge policy was not followed. 4. A student drew a gang symbol on his hand in middle school. He told the principal he saw it in a library book. The principal came to me and made me take every book off the shelves that related to gangs (even ones that tried to deter kids from joining). It turned out that the student actually saw it in a Guinness Book of World Records article related to the largest gangs or something like that. Once again the challenge policy was not followed. Can you tell we live in a small rural conservative area? I am often afraid I might lose my job because of books I purchase, especially, here at the high school where I now work. The content for this age level is much more mature than it was 2-3 decades ago when most of the administration and I were in school. So frustrating!",South Atlantic,Rural,0,0,1

"I am very careful with book selection, spending hours and hours reading both print and on line sources. I do buy urban fiction with somewhat explicit sexual content, but I had to draw the line at 50 SHADES as inappropriate for a public high school. I told students who asked that they could get it at their local public library. I have never had a book challenged, but I feel I could justify most, if not all my selections. I will occasionally choose not to purchase a book it I feel it is too YOUNG for my readers, although I do purchase Hi-LO books for struggling or relectant readers.",Northeast,Urban,0,0,1

I buy what I can afford based on my practically nonexistent budget from places such as bargain tables at book stores, yard sales and I accept donations!

"I experienced a book challenge with a comic book ( Dance class) about a school of young ballerinas. Parents were concerned with the images of thin ballerinas arguing that it was promoting an unhealthy lifestyle and nutrition.

It is a graphic novel but it didn't show anything and didn't even state right out that he saw anything. And only the adults drank beer and it wasn't a big part of the story. The town met in the pub for a town meeting as they used to do, and some partook of the drinks available. It went all the way up to the school board because she really wanted it gone. The book won and I didn't have to pull it.",Mountain,Suburban,1,0,0
"I had a parent complain about content in a fiction title that used the f word quite often. I was called in to the Principal's office and told that the title was being pulled. He said, basically, ""no f word."" I sent him the reviews and explained that I wouldn't necessarily know when the word is being used based on what information I am given. End of story. I try to avoid what I consider ""offensive"" words, but I do not consider them damaging to a 14 year old. Would I want my own 6th grader reading those words? No. It is a fine line. I suppose that I, personally, object to profanity over anything else I have encountered in young adult literature. Although, most recently, I purchased the award winning graphic novel This One Summer and pulled it off the shelf after reading it, as I felt it had no socially redeeming value. Self censorship?

The parent told me that she does not teach her child these things and that the book should be taken off the shelf. I read the book myself and personally did not like the content myself either. However, I realized that the book was written, not to be disrespectful, but to be fun and entertaining for children.

"I have experienced many books challenges in my career (past 35 years), in IA, SD & CT in 4 different school districts. First in Iowa, in 1982, in small school district, with Headman by Kin Platt for the language in M.S. and moved it up to H.S. Library. Second and Third and Fourth in South Dakota, in 1982-84 for ""Trying Hard to Hear You"" for same sex kiss, then for Books on a Senior Independent Reading list where a Principal wanted any title that had ever been questioned removed (retained all books after lengthy explanation of Senior Students having right to choose). Then in 1984, with the MARSHALL CAVENDISH DOCTOR'S ANSWERS MEDICAL HEALTH ENCYCLOPEDIA, which had questionable pictures in the ""S"" Volume, administrator tried to pull/censor entire encyclopedia, retained the encyclopedia with restriction to ""Cover"" the pictures in that volume that adminstration ordered. Then, in 1986, in a rural town, in CT, with a joint Public and School Library, where parent kept 'checking out' then 'losing"" the VC Andrews Book ""Flowers in the Attic"" to try to censor the Library. Then in 1994, when an elementary school in our suburban school district tried to censor Goosebumps, at that time our Selection Policy and Adminstration responsible for the committee to review books in question, operated well. Goosebumps challenge resulted in the books staying on the shelves and the parent being told they may limit what their own child reads but the school would not be removing these books that were age appropriate from the library. Then in 2003, we had an Elementary School Principal pull ""Heart of a Chief"" from the Library due to a confused discussion from a parent claiming they discussed ""abortion"" in class... which was a misunderstanding... but the Selection Policy Reconsideration Policy was not followed and it took a year to get it back in the Library. Then in 2007, we had a H.S. Principal ask about E.Lockhart's ""Boy Book"" as a parent phoned about it, not wanting his daughter (15 yr old) to be allowed to check it out... and then a second book ""The boyfriend list""... as the Principal partially tried to censor by checking the two books out and sitting on them for 8 months and claimed we didn't want our girls reading a book that had a chapter on ""Boobs"" ... (a chapter was titles ""boobs"" but was just teen angst writings in a diary of sorts shared by young teen girls.

She told me she talks to her daughter at length about what she reads and asks her if she thinks each book is an appropriate choice and why. I was able to very honestly praise her for her engaging, empathetic parenting style and told her I wish more parents would take such an active role in their children's reading experiences.

I encouraged the mother to continue to influence her daughter and that I couldn't justify denying a book to students who would enjoy it.

If a young person is not yet interested in dating, he or she will not select books about dating. The reverse is also true, and I don't want parents unnecessarily limiting their child's book choices. In the past, I have helped students figure out a way to hide books from their parents, but I never got the chance in this case.

"So much of deciding to include any controversial books in the collection is knowing exactly how an activity is represented in the book. It's all about the context and whether the characters experience any consequences after participating in risky behaviors. I would love to see thorough reviews of books that advise of any potentially inappropriate material. I read reviews at Common Sense Media and scour the internet looking for insight before I buy any books, but many of the newer popular books are hard to find. I feel like I do a good job of having a good mix of books that don't protect our students from life but gives it to them in baby steps.",South Central,Suburban,0,1,0

"The book was selected prior to me being a librarian on campus. It had great reviews, and an absolutely wonderful story. The objection was sex, violence, language, and suicide. At that time I had 6th grade on campus. In a committee including a parent, a teacher from each grade level, the principal, and myself, the decision was made that the book was more appropriate for Junior High. Ironically, it was a 4th grade teacher and myself that fought for the overall story of the book. It is my opinion, although all involved were required to read the entire the book, that they paid too much attention to the specific parts mentioned, because that was the focus of their discussion. Sixth grade is now on the Junior High campus and I now teach all my students how to select books appropriate for them and their family guidelines and what to do if they think a book is inappropriate for them...return it and get another, because that book IS appropriate for someone else.",South Central,Suburban,1,0,0

"The first challenge I experienced forced our administration (at the time they all valued libraries) to create a more specific reconsideration policy. The title went to a diverse committee who read the book and reconvened to discuss our options. The decision was made to keep the book but get parental approval in the form of a signature before allowing students to check out the book. This past school year the reconsideration policy was completely ignored when a district office staff member (bookkeeper) didn't like titles on one of my orders and brought it to the attention of the curriculum director. She removed the books from our collection, without discussing it with me, and the rest of the school year I was bullied and harassed by my building administration because I questioned the whole situation's legitimacy. Now I am very careful about what I purchase and the titles of books because I cannot survive the bullying I went through last year again and/or retain my position .",Midwest,Suburban,0,1,0

We do have the YA limiter for mature content, but we also have the rare opportunity to have the public library attached to our library. Kids have access there if their parents want them to have access.

"When I started to work here in the Middle School Library, I was told there is a no restriction on books. There were books already in the library that had profanity, ect., Then a parent went to our principal and showed her a page in the book that had profanity. I was told to watch this carefully. I decided to make a teen section of the library. This makes it easy for me to view who is looking at these books and it is easy for me to know who is checking these books out. When the student checks out these books, I request a parental note. This is a general note stating that the student can check out young adult books. This has been working for the most part. some notes have come in as colorful as the books. (too descriptive). Having a note from the parent, makes me feel better. One more thing, in general I don't let my sixth graders check out these books, but if they bring me a note from parents. I let them. Also, when I receive a note, I call the parent to make sure the note came from the parent. * This was an excellent question. I must say that when ordering books, there is not enough information on content. like profanity ect. Although I worry about the content, the subject matter is what the students like and read.

They were concerned that children in the school might actually be in that situation and having the book in our collection would either add to the stigma or condone the situation (of having a parent who is incarcerated). They wanted to keep it in the counselor's office for the counselor to decide whether it would be appropriate for certain students.
