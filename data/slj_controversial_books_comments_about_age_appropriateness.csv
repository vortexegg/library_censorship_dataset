"This is such a dilemma for me as my age group spans from immature 6th grader to mature 8th grader.

I farm out some titles to teachers who are willing to read and give feedback. Sometimes I check out a website called Common Sense Media for their comments.

We look at the reviews and at the content. We are a middle school that serves grades 7-9. Are students read beyond their years often with the encouragement of their parents. I would say that the content that stops us the most if it the sexuality is over the top for this age group. We recently decided against a few graphic novels because of the inference to rape and the full frontal nudity which is even more impactful in a graphic novel. We take controversial issues under consideration when it is overtly biased and/or there is not a representation of the other side.,Pacific,Urban,0,1,1

"Well, since I have only 'non-selected' two books in my eight years here, I obviously interpret age appropriateness quite broadly. Among our 11- to 14-year-old students, we have enormously wide reading and interest level ranges, so I feel that pretty much gives me carte blanche to select as broadly as fits our students' diverse needs. I feel a strong responsibility to represent as many interests, levels, groups, cultures, minorities, genders, sexualities, etc. as possible and try to do so while roughly following the bell curve of popular interest books. Funny story: we have a strong collection of books about sex including ""How Sex Works"", ""What's the Big Secret"", ""Sex, Puberty, and All That Stuff"" and many more, and I keep them on a shelf that allows a reasonable amount of privacy. Plus, the book spines and shelf have matching blue dots to make them easy for the students to find and for my library assistant and me to re-shelve Every. Single. Day. :) The sex books constantly get stashed and hidden in various other nooks--hey--maybe I should GPS tag them! Anyway, here's the funny part: every school year, during the first few months, the sixth graders gradually discover these books. For the last few years, I've had an amazing number of sixth graders, mostly boys, running over to me, very upset, complaining about the sex book section! ""Did you know there are books about s-e-x over there, Mrs. B?"" ""Why are they there?"" ""I think you should get rid of those!"" Okay, now for the mistakes. I have a high school and college background and have a tendency to over-estimate my students' reading and interest levels. Any time I really blow it, I just send those books up to the local high school where the students will get 4 more years to consider them.",Pacific,Rural,0,1,0
