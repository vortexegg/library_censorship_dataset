Weighing Subject Matter,I read for an Awards program where the publishers allow us to keep our books at the end of the year. Sometimes I am a little shocked about what I find in a few of these books. I am of two minds about them. One is that it is censorship to not put these books on the shelves. The reality is that some kids are very interested in them.

If the answer is no to the first and yes to the second I have to pause. Since we have open shelves and I have virtually no library budget I cannot afford to spend book fair earnings and grant money on books that aren't appropriate for the widest range of kids I serve. I review a lot of books and typically send books up to the middle school that I know won't fit my kids down here, knowing that my students will have access to that material when they hit middle school and it is a better fit. Sometimes I send things up to the high school they are truly YA with the same thought. I read every single book before it goes on my library shelves and there are things on the shelves that I don't agree with, and that have the occasional profanity (hey, you gotta have Gary Paulsen, right?)

Comments About Age-Appropriateness,"Well, since I have only 'non-selected' two books in my eight years here, I obviously interpret age appropriateness quite broadly. Among our 11- to 14-year-old students, we have enormously wide reading and interest level ranges, so I feel that pretty much gives me carte blanche to select as broadly as fits our students' diverse needs. I feel a strong responsibility to represent as many interests, levels, groups, cultures, minorities, genders, sexualities, etc. as possible and try to do so while roughly following the bell curve of popular interest books. Funny story: we have a strong collection of books about sex including ""How Sex Works"", ""What's the Big Secret"", ""Sex, Puberty, and All That Stuff"" and many more, and I keep them on a shelf that allows a reasonable amount of privacy. Plus, the book spines and shelf have matching blue dots to make them easy for the students to find and for my library assistant and me to re-shelve Every. Single. Day. :) The sex books constantly get stashed and hidden in various other nooks--hey--maybe I should GPS tag them! Anyway, here's the funny part: every school year, during the first few months, the sixth graders gradually discover these books. For the last few years, I've had an amazing number of sixth graders, mostly boys, running over to me, very upset, complaining about the sex book section! ""Did you know there are books about s-e-x over there, Mrs. B?"" ""Why are they there?"" ""I think you should get rid of those!"" Okay, now for the mistakes. I have a high school and college background and have a tendency to over-estimate my students' reading and interest levels. Any time I really blow it, I just send those books up to the local high school where the students will get 4 more years to consider them.",Pacific,Rural,0,1,0

Comments About Book Challenges,"A parent came in and wanted the book Wicked : the life and times of the wicked witch of the West : a novel, by Gregory Maguire taken off the shelf because of its content. I received information from my principal about a committee that was being formed to make the review. I read the book and made detailed notes on everything I thought she could object to. She came in to find out the particulars and I told her that in order for the challenge to go forward, one of the stipulations by the district review process was that she had to read the entire book so she could see the ""problems"" in the context of the whole book. She was unwilling to do that, so the challenge was dropped and the book stayed on the shelf. I have a sign in my library that very plainly states that there are all kinds of books on the shelves and it is up to the readers and their parents to decide what is best for them. I also sometimes use a little shoe store analogy with students who question my choice of books. When you go to a shoe store, do you throw away every pair of shoes you take off the shelf and don't like? No, you put them back and pretty soon someone will come along who likes those shoes.",Mountain,Suburban,0,0,1

Comments About Book Challenges,"Almost Perfect by Brian Katcher A parent bypassed the in place reconsideration form and sent 20 annotated pages of the book ( with underlined offensive content AND the reasons she believed it was inappropriate) to every member of the school board and superintendent without discussing the matter with me first. The board immediately required a committee set up (the next day--without giving time for the committee to read the book). The committee, consisting of the principal, a teacher, two parents and myself, decided to keep the book. When the parent was unhappy with the outcome, a district committee was formed. They decided to move the book to the high school. As a result, my superintendent wanted a list of ""all of the books that could be considered controversial"". I told him that my list would include every book in the collection, because someone might find any book offensive. I also said the book at the top of the list would be the Bible. We compromised, he insisted on permission slips to check out ""mature content"" books.",Midwest,Suburban,0,1,0

I read both books, thought they were probably a little mature for 6th grade, but definitely saw the value in having them in the collection for older students. I explained to parents why they were important to have in the collection, but understood their concerns (language, drug/alcohol use, sexual situation). I put a YA sticker on them, and now if 6th grade students want to check out those books they have to have parent permission.

Comments About Book Challenges,"Graphic novel...This One Summer...many students were returning it complaining of content. Attempted to discuss ...did they notice the difference in the way the character responded to the female and males in text etc...no go ...couldn't get past the strong language...mention of topics like blow jobs...etc Finally one student and her parent had brought the text in with sticky notes on all the pages with strong language, mention of porn, and the male sexual conversations. There were more than 25 sticky notes. She was offered the proper paperwork etc. During review I was able to convince them how this text really speaks to some students even though I myself was surprised by the highly controversial material for our ages. It is a book that begs analysis with peers but so many of our students found it offensive and I respect the desire to draw the line...The reviews DID NOT GO far enough in sharing about the controversial content for middle school students to inform my purchase.

Comments About Book Challenges,"I am the coordinator of librarians in my county so I have info from other schools as well: 1. The book ""Flowers in the Attic"" (which was purchased by the previous librarian and in the collection for many years) was challenged when I worked at a middle school. It, however, was not an official challenge because our administration does not follow the School Board approved challenge policy and just pulls books off the shelves if a parent objects. :( It was removed and I sent it to the high school. 2. This year a parent complained about sexual content in a book called ""Mostly Good Girls"". The school serves grades 6-12. A middle school aged student had checked it out. The principal called me at home, since I am the ""head"" librarian, to fuss about the book (I do not work in that building); he took the book and it disappeared. That school has a policy that if a book is recommended as YA a spine label is attached so ""only"" high schoolers can check it out and it not allowed for middle school students. This book was YA in the reviews but the label was not affixed to it. Once again the challenge policy was not followed. 3. A parent at an elementary school complained that the giant in ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" gets drunk. All copies of the book were pulled from the library shelves in our entire county. SIGH Once again the challenge policy was not followed. 4. A student drew a gang symbol on his hand in middle school. He told the principal he saw it in a library book. The principal came to me and made me take every book off the shelves that related to gangs (even ones that tried to deter kids from joining). It turned out that the student actually saw it in a Guinness Book of World Records article related to the largest gangs or something like that. Once again the challenge policy was not followed. Can you tell we live in a small rural conservative area? I am often afraid I might lose my job because of books I purchase, especially, here at the high school where I now work.

Comments About Book Challenges,"I have experienced many books challenges in my career (past 35 years), in IA, SD & CT in 4 different school districts. First in Iowa, in 1982, in small school district, with Headman by Kin Platt for the language in M.S. and moved it up to H.S. Library. Second and Third and Fourth in South Dakota, in 1982-84 for ""Trying Hard to Hear You"" for same sex kiss, then for Books on a Senior Independent Reading list where a Principal wanted any title that had ever been questioned removed (retained all books after lengthy explanation of Senior Students having right to choose). Then in 1984, with the MARSHALL CAVENDISH DOCTOR'S ANSWERS MEDICAL HEALTH ENCYCLOPEDIA, which had questionable pictures in the ""S"" Volume, administrator tried to pull/censor entire encyclopedia, retained the encyclopedia with restriction to ""Cover"" the pictures in that volume that adminstration ordered. Then, in 1986, in a rural town, in CT, with a joint Public and School Library, where parent kept 'checking out' then 'losing"" the VC Andrews Book ""Flowers in the Attic"" to try to censor the Library. Then in 1994, when an elementary school in our suburban school district tried to censor Goosebumps, at that time our Selection Policy and Adminstration responsible for the committee to review books in question, operated well. Goosebumps challenge resulted in the books staying on the shelves and the parent being told they may limit what their own child reads but the school would not be removing these books that were age appropriate from the library. Then in 2003, we had an Elementary School Principal pull ""Heart of a Chief"" from the Library due to a confused discussion from a parent claiming they discussed ""abortion"" in class... which was a misunderstanding... but the Selection Policy Reconsideration Policy was not followed and it took a year to get it back in the Library. Then in 2007, we had a H.S. Principal ask about E.Lockhart's ""Boy Book"" as a parent phoned about it, not wanting his daughter (15 yr old) to be allowed to check it out... and then a second book ""The boyfriend list""... as the Principal partially tried to censor by checking the two books out and sitting on them for 8 months and claimed we didn't want our girls reading a book that had a chapter on ""Boobs"" ...

He was mainly a Spanish speaker, so he was intimidated by that suggestion and withdrew the challenge.

Comments About Book Challenges,I personally have opted to not put a book on the shelf because of the graphic sexual content. It was an LGBT purchase that went into great detail about a rape and other experiences. Even for mature high school students it was a bit much.

He read it and said that it was graphically violent and he questioned the book, too. I read one of two of the series, agreed, and removed the set from the library. I wrote a letter to the parent informing him of the decision.

It had an old accelerated reader tag on the book stating 4.?. I was new to the library at that time. The principal who has no idea how a library is run (and doesn't care to know) was also upset that we had a book in our library that made reference to a rape by a man of his wife. I explained to the parent that we do not restrict what students check out for the most part and that it was up to her to decide if her child should be reading a certain book. I explained where one parent would not want their child to read that kind of material another parent would be okay with it. I showed her how to log into our library from home to check what books would be acceptable for her daughter to check out and she was agreeable to it. I mentioned to her that she could have her daughter bring home the books she checked out and she could look them over before she read them.

I had a parent actually deface a book and would not return or replace one of my Harry Potter's when the first came out.

I have had students mention that there is a ""bad"" word or other mature things such as artwork in books. I try to always take the high road. I ask to see the bad word, Wednesday it was the word, ""beer"". I explained the content of the comment, and the student was fine with the explanation. Other times, they have decided to turn in the book. One Eyewitness book with nude artwork was quite an issue with some very young patrons. I explained that it was ""ART"" not nudity, and only for big kids and adults to enjoy. If they were giggling, they were too immature to read that book and the teacher would return it, then they wouldn't have anything to read. They got mature really quickly.

Comments About Book Challenges,Often the school library is the only access a student has to information and it is difficult to make the determination of what can and what cannot be on the shelves. Many students at my school do not go to the public library and the school library is the place where they are exposed to what a library has to offer. I do not feel it is my job to regulate what high school students read or have access to as many are almost adults. School libraries want to provide information and support curriculum and that is exactly what School Librarians do. Independent reading is a big part of the Language Arts curriculum and many books from Harry Potter to Ellen Hopkins to Nicholas Sparks contain subject matter that may be deemed controversial but that is up to families to determine individually.,Mountain,Urban,0,0,1

The department chairperson had removed the book from both the junior high and high school library shelves the night before I learned of the challenge.

If the principal agrees with the person questioning the books presence than it will be removed from the shelves."" The superintendent, principal, and library department chairperson refused to read the book, saying that the areas that the parent pointed out were so awful that there was no question in their minds that it should be removed.

Comments About Book Challenges,"One time I had a parent of a 7th-grade girl object to a book she was reading that referenced ""hook-ups"". The parent, a young, highly religious Christian woman, sat down with me and very calmly explained what she didn't like about the book. She told me she talks to her daughter at length about what she reads and asks her if she thinks each book is an appropriate choice and why. I was able to very honestly praise her for her engaging, empathetic parenting style and told her I wish more parents would take such an active role in their children's reading experiences. And I also mentioned that we have some very mature students who are older who are ready for such books and enjoy them. I encouraged the mother to continue to influence her daughter and that I couldn't justify denying a book to students who would enjoy it. We parted amicably, and I have great respect for the parent and told her so. She never took the request higher. It is my experience that students only read the books they are ready to read. If a young person is not yet interested in dating, he or she will not select books about dating. The reverse is also true, and I don't want parents unnecessarily limiting their child's book choices. In the past, I have helped students figure out a way to hide books from their parents, but I never got the chance in this case. The student spent less and less time in the library and I never got the chance. I have a teenage daughter. I hope she reads books that she won't tell me about.",Pacific,Rural,0,1,0

Comments About Book Challenges,"Several years ago we had a challenge on one of the Lone Star titles.

Within the next couple of years, we also had a challenge about a magazine, which was also removed, based on the inappropriateness of advertisements. The magazine was somewhat less defensible, and the principal did not go through the process, just telling me to take it off the shelves. We are a very conservative community, and some years before the district had experienced a challenge over Huckleberry Finn, which resulted in a lot of publicity and controversy.

Comments About Book Challenges,"Since I only work part time at my library, when a parent/employee brought to my attention a book's cover that was personally offensive to her, rather than risking a book challenge and losing support, I chose to remove the book from the collection.

There is also a library assistant that could have either purchased personally, acquired through donation, or chose from a parent group run book fair donation, that book or any number of books/materials in this particular library. Materials in elementary libraries many times are added to libraries by people not educated on collection development nor worried that they be held accountable for the collection (book) challenges that may occur. Unfortunately, our children's need and desire for new materials, lack of funding for elementary librarians, lack of sustainable if any funding for books/materials, and the assumption that every child can ""read on an electronic device"", has pushed library assistants and teacher-librarians to allow less than quality or adequately reviewed materials to be cataloged and then checked out to children.

It took almost as much time and effort with the parent as with my administration to look more closely at the book in question and reach a reasonable decision. We ended up not removing the book, although it was pulled from the collection during this time.",Pacific,Suburban,0,1,0
Comments About Book Challenges,The challenge was a classroom assigned novel by a local author. The student was given an alternate assignment and the challenge was denied. The author did write a second version of his book that removed the small sex scene and he replaced our books for free (I think). They are still in our textbook room and may be used again next year for a remedial English IV class.,Pacific,Small Town,0,0,1
Comments About Book Challenges,"The challenge was based on a picture of two adult males holding hands. The parent had not read the book in its entirety.

Comments About Book Challenges,"The closest to a book challenge that I experienced was being contacted by the building principal to find out if we had a copy of ""Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks a Lot"". It was causing a controversy in the area and they (District Superintendent) were checking to see if we had the book on the shelf and, if we did, to pull it. We did not have a copy. Thankfully, I did not have to push the censorship issue (this time). We currently have a pretty lenient policy regarding books that are allowed on our shelves.",Midwest,Suburban,0,0,1

Comments About Book Challenges,"The first challenge I experienced forced our administration (at the time they all valued libraries) to create a more specific reconsideration policy. The title went to a diverse committee who read the book and reconvened to discuss our options. The decision was made to keep the book but get parental approval in the form of a signature before allowing students to check out the book. This past school year the reconsideration policy was completely ignored when a district office staff member (bookkeeper) didn't like titles on one of my orders and brought it to the attention of the curriculum director. She removed the books from our collection, without discussing it with me, and the rest of the school year I was bullied and harassed by my building administration because I questioned the whole situation's legitimacy. Now I am very careful about what I purchase and the titles of books because I cannot survive the bullying I went through last year again and/or retain my position .",Midwest,Suburban,0,1,0
Comments About Book Challenges,The main book challenge I faced was from my library administrator who is very sensitive to foul language.

Comments About Book Challenges,"The parent was very, very conservative and since both parents were not on the same page of being aware of haven giving consent for borrowing from YA section (it may have been a case of a forged signature by the student).

Comments About Book Challenges,The recent book challenge I had encountered was from the book entitled Drama.

I was then questioned how book selection was decided.,Northeast,Suburban,1,0,0
Comments About Book Challenges,"The student questioned a right-leaning college information book. Because the title could be interpreted as meaning ""correct"" rather than political-right, we added a sticker so that it was clear that it was politically leaning rather than ""correct"". I refused to remove the book because it was helpful for some of our students who would like the information in choosing a college, but the title could be misleading, so I clarified it. We have many other ""controversial"" books here, and I'm happy about that. Luckily, so is the administration and the general population of the town.",Northeast,Small Town,0,0,1
Comments About Book Challenges,"The teacher backed down when I informed her there was a process I was going to make her go through.

Comments About Book Challenges,"There was a challenge by a parent of, Rumble Fish by S. E. Hinton. We had just established a review procedure for such a challenge and followed it to the letter.

Comments About Book Challenges,"This is my third year as a librarian, following 23 years in the high school English classroom. We have had an incident where an administrator has told me that a particular student is not allowed to checkout a particular title per parent request and another incident where a student was reading the ""bad parts"" aloud to class mates and the administrator disciplined the student. We do have the YA limiter for mature content, but we also have the rare opportunity to have the public library attached to our library. Kids have access there if their parents want them to have access. I stress to students that any book could be offensive to someone, that in fact the greatest books in literature have been among the most controversial. I also encourage students to talk to their parents about what is acceptable in their own household.",Midwest,Suburban,0,1,1
Comments About Book Challenges,"This one summer was challenged in my school by a parent who let her daughter read John Green books! I truly believe it was partly due to the fact that it is a graphic novel. She complained about the inappropriate content, and included miscarriage in that definition.

My challenge was in the elementary school over the language in a book, and it was over words like God, hell, and damn. The parent damaged the book so it was removed. It may have been ""The Great Gilly Hopkins"", but I'm not sure. It was years ago when I was an elementary librarian. I think we got another copy or already had one. I tried to tell the kids that if they didn't like something about a book (or their parents didn't, then just bring them back and get a different one).

Comments About Book Challenges,"When I started to work here in the Middle School Library, I was told there is a no restriction on books. There were books already in the library that had profanity, ect., Then a parent went to our principal and showed her a page in the book that had profanity. I was told to watch this carefully. I decided to make a teen section of the library. This makes it easy for me to view who is looking at these books and it is easy for me to know who is checking these books out. When the student checks out these books, I request a parental note. This is a general note stating that the student can check out young adult books. This has been working for the most part. some notes have come in as colorful as the books. (too descriptive). Having a note from the parent, makes me feel better. One more thing, in general I don't let my sixth graders check out these books, but if they bring me a note from parents. I let them. Also, when I receive a note, I call the parent to make sure the note came from the parent. * This was an excellent question. I must say that when ordering books, there is not enough information on content. like profanity ect. Although I worry about the content, the subject matter is what the students like and read. The students lives way more each day, then the content they read. Thanks again Middle School Librarian",Pacific,Rural,0,1,0

I talked him out of it with the help of his wife, who agreed that the book was appropriate for a middle school library. His daughter was in sixth grade, and he felt a book that even discussed losing virginity was inappropriate despite the fact the character was a virgin and made very positive points about staying that way.

Comments About Book Challenges,"While not a formal challenge, I received pressure to remove a book that dealt with kids who have a parent in jail or prison. The pressure came from the principal and the school counselor (apparently, the book was passed around when the order came in and before the book even got to the library). They were concerned that children in the school might actually be in that situation and having the book in our collection would either add to the stigma or condone the situation (of having a parent who is incarcerated). They wanted to keep it in the counselor's office for the counselor to decide whether it would be appropriate for certain students. As soon as I got out the paperwork for filing a challenge, they backed off, but I think it colored their perception of me after that. This was an elementary school.",Mountain,Suburban,0,1,0
