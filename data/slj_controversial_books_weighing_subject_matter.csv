A middle school library's collection should cover a wide range of topics that enhances the core curriculum. The level of maturity of the readers influences the types of books purchased.,Midwest,Small Town,0,1,0
A parent complained and the principal asked that the item be removed.,Northeast,Suburban,0,1,0
Actually I find I am being more liberal with content because I think that our parent population is more tolerant.,South Central,Urban,1,1,0
"Actually less, since society and our local community members are more broad-minded than in previous decades. I am also bolder in making selection choices. We are a very large school with a diverse population. We can't ignore providing reading materials which reflect the realities of all our students' lives.",Midwest,Suburban,0,1,0

"Adult level controversial subject matter is making its way into literature for younger readers.

"An administrator at one of the buildings at which I serve as the library media specialist pre-censored several books for his school at the direction of the superintendent, and I now consider controversial subject matter more carefully at other levels.",Midwest,Small Town,1,1,1
"Authors are actually writing more books about controversial topics, which is a good thing, but people are also much more angered by and vocal about controversial topics than ever before.

Because of administrators or school board members,Northeast,Suburban,1,0,0
Because of the demographics of this particular school and area. The Principal and the parents prefer not to have this type of subject matter in the younger grades. I would possibly include it in our designated 7th/8th grade only section.,Mountain,Suburban,1,1,0

Controversial topics seem to be more prevalent now than a decade ago. I don't know about one or two years ago.,Mountain,Rural,0,1,1
"Controversial/Inappropriate subject matter used to be something that was confined to young adult and adult selections.

"I am in a 5-8 grade school - which is really tricky because I don't separate the collection. Swearing and relationship/sex content is showing up in books for younger children now. What used to be 9-12 is pushed down to 7th now. Also I feel like there is an expectation that content provided from a school should be sanitized? I don't know if that is the right word.

I notice a lot more books that are controversial. My school does not support this trend in children's literature.,Midwest,Suburban,1,0,0
I pass on titles that are poorly written and full of vulgar slang and or inappropriate dialog just for the shock value. I bought The Martian for my middle school even though it has profanity because we offer Engineering as an 8th grade elective. The title celebrates engineers and science.,Pacific,Suburban,0,1,0
I purchase more new fiction.,South Central,Small Town,0,0,1
I read for an Awards program where the publishers allow us to keep our books at the end of the year. Sometimes I am a little shocked about what I find in a few of these books. I am of two minds about them. One is that it is censorship to not put these books on the shelves. The reality is that some kids are very interested in them. The other is that some of the sexual content is almost (not quite) pornographic and I am not sure they are appropriate for high school students. Feedback about this would be nice. :-),Pacific,Urban,0,0,1

I'm covering multiple buildings and students at my Intermediate (4-6) often request books from the Middle school where I also work - I feel students are being exposed in detail to topics they are not ready for simply because they want to read what they are seeing advertised or parents/older siblings are reading. I tell them there is nothing wrong with the book they have requested however based on the content I have not selected it for the Intermediate level and if they are still interested in the book they have 2 choices - the public library or wait until they get to the middle school.,Northeast,Suburban,1,1,0

"In the past the YA books weren't as edgy or as mature. My 8th graders want to read YA books that my 6th graders are not ready for and that their parents would not appreciate in the MS library.

Even when delicately handled, that does not fit into my town's middle school library.",Northeast,Small Town,0,1,0

It appears that authors are more increasingly pushing boundaries in young adult books especially in the fiction area.,Pacific,Urban,0,0,1
"It feels like parents feel they can be much more vocal about their objections to library materials, and they don't feel like they need to be polite about it. I recently was called on the carpet by a parent for allowing his son, a 7th grader, to check-out a book intended for students in grades 9-12. His son had been checking out materials aimed at upper school students since this academic year began and the father had never said a word.

More and more the laws are leaning toward groups most vocal about their agendas. Are school librarians covered under the free speech amendment?

Purchasing for middle school is difficult because of the maturity levels of our students ranging from 10 years old to teenage.

"Sexual situations, big increase in profane language...I have so little $...it is disappointing to purchase a book that I find out is controversial for middle schoolers and I have to provide a warning it may be mature...which is a euphemism for what very well is inappropriate for a 12 year old . I used to think I was so open to controversial text but I see our youth so sexualized at young ages and where once it was important to explore the gray areas as they matured...now they bring the books back because they are feeling a bit dirty as if the language or situation is too much..I try to be comforting and accepting ....honestly one last summer is one of those books...some love it ...some cringe.",South Central,Small Town,0,1,0

Isn't it time to assist them in becoming normal, well-adjusted individuals? What we need are good clean books that portray values we need again in this country.",South Central,Small Town,0,0,1
"The LGBT books in particular...In the last couple of years I have become even more committed to purchasing and making available books with an LGBT theme that are still appropriate for middle school (in particular I try to avoid too much of the F-word, and any sexual content that is too mature in a middle school context; i.e. ""going all the way""). I am committed to putting as many of these books in my library as possible because there are students who need them badly, and they're an under-represented group. I would also like for my non-LGBT students to read them in order to promote more acceptance of their peers who struggle with these issues, and to learn to treat everybody kindly.",Midwest,N/A,0,0,0

I am not afraid of cutting-edge content and I absolutely showcase controversial subjects, but I am finally realizing that, as a school librarian, I do need at least a small amount of literary merit or curricular relevance to justify purchasing a book with state funds.
