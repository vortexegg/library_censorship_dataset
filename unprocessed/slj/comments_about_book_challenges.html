Materials in elementary libraries many times are added to libraries by people not educated on collection development nor worried that they be held accountable for the collection (book) challenges that may occur. Unfortunately, our children's need and desire for new materials, lack of funding for elementary librarians, lack of sustainable if any funding for books/materials, and the assumption that every child can "read on an electronic device", has pushed library assistants and teacher-librarians to allow less than quality or adequately reviewed materials to be cataloged and then checked out to children.

This past school year the reconsideration policy was completely ignored when a district office staff member (bookkeeper) didn't like titles on one of my orders and brought it to the attention of the curriculum director. She removed the books from our collection, without discussing it with me, and the rest of the school year I was bullied and harassed by my building administration because I questioned the whole situation's legitimacy.

I decided to make a teen section of the library. This makes it easy for me to view who is looking at these books and it is easy for me to know who is checking these books out. When the student checks out these books, I request a parental note. This is a general note stating that the student can check out young adult books. This has been working for the most part. some notes have come in as colorful as the books. (too descriptive). Having a note from the parent, makes me feel better. One more thing, in general I don't let my sixth graders check out these books, but if they bring me a note from parents. I let them. Also, when I receive a note, I call the parent to make sure the note came from the parent. * This was an excellent question. I must say that when ordering books, there is not enough information on content. like profanity ect. Although I worry about the content, the subject matter is what the students like and read.

I had a complaint, once, about Jane Yolan's "Devil's Arithmetic". The parent thought we shouldn't have books on the occult. ( I assume the SLJ audience knows the book is about WW II and the Auschwitz number tattoos on prisoners.) The parent was quite embarrassed when faced with the reality.
